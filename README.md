## How It Works

![Flywheel Diagram][flywheel-diagram]

```
Collect              Analyze            Store             Evolve
────────────         ──────────         ───────           ──────────────
YouTube / Web   →    NotebookLM    →    Obsidian    →    CLAUDE.md    →  Better AI
PDF / Text           (free Google AI)   (your vault)     (append-only)    └── loop
```

Each research session feeds back into your AI -- making the next session smarter. Here is a concrete walkthrough:

Say you want to research "AI agent architectures". Here is what happens:

1. **Collect** -- `/research-pipeline youtube "AI agent architectures"` searches YouTube via yt-dlp. You see a ranked table of results and pick the 3 most relevant videos.
2. **Analyze** -- Revolve sends the selected videos to NotebookLM, which processes them and produces structured analysis: key concepts, comparisons across sources, and practical takeaways. This runs on Google's infrastructure, not your Claude tokens.
3. **Store** -- Results are written as a formatted Obsidian note with YAML frontmatter, tags, source links, and a full analysis section -- ready for your knowledge base.
4. **Evolve** -- `/evolve-claude-md` scans your recent research notes and raw conversation logs (.jsonl), extracts patterns like "user prefers agent-first architecture" or "NotebookLM auth expires weekly -- run `nlm login` to fix", and appends them to CLAUDE.md.

Next time you ask Claude about architecture, it already knows your preferences and past research. The flywheel closes automatically.

## What You Get

Each research session produces an Obsidian note like this:

```markdown
---
date: 2026-04-02
topic: AI Agent Architectures
source_type: youtube
notebook_id: nbl_a7x9k2m
tags:
  - research
  - ai-agents
  - architecture
status: complete
---

# AI Agent Architectures

> Sources: 3 YouTube videos | Analysis engine: NotebookLM

## Summary

Multi-agent systems outperform single-agent setups for complex tasks.
The key tradeoff is between orchestrator control and agent autonomy...

## Key Findings

- ReAct-style agents work best for tool-heavy tasks with clear APIs
- Hierarchical delegation (planner → executor → reviewer) reduces error
  propagation by 40% compared to flat agent pools
- Memory systems (vector DB + structured logs) are more important than
  model choice for long-running agent workflows

## Analysis

### Agent Communication Patterns
...

## Sources

- "Building Multi-Agent Systems" by AI Engineering (12:34)
- "ReAct vs Plan-and-Execute" by Tech Frontiers (18:02)
- "Production Agent Architectures" by ML Ops Community (24:15)

## Links

- NotebookLM notebook: https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/nbl_a7x9k2m
```

Over time, `/evolve-claude-md` appends findings like these to your CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
# Evolution Log

## 2026-04-02 Evolution

Based on 328 sessions (.jsonl) + 94 notes analyzed over 7 days.

New findings:
- [Tool Pattern] yt-dlp search with `--flat-playlist --dump-json` is the most reliable method
- [Error Recovery] NotebookLM auth expires weekly -- `nlm login` restores it instantly
- [User Correction] Never auto-commit without explicit user confirmation
- [Work Preference] User prefers table comparisons over prose for architecture decisions
- [New Knowledge] Hierarchical agent delegation reduces error propagation significantly
```

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Required | Install |
|------------|----------|---------|
| [Claude Code][claude-code] | Yes | -- |
| [Obsidian][obsidian] vault | Yes | -- |
| NotebookLM MCP server | Yes | See [NotebookLM MCP Setup][nlm-setup] below |
| yt-dlp | Yes (YouTube) | `brew install yt-dlp` or `pip install yt-dlp` |
| defuddle | Optional | `npm install -g defuddle-cli` |
| Python 3.8+ | Yes (sync script) | Pre-installed on macOS |
| fswatch | Optional (auto-sync) | `brew install fswatch` |

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]][readme-top]

</div>

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/eisen0419/revolve
claude plugin install revolve
```

### NotebookLM MCP Setup (Required)

NotebookLM is the analysis engine that powers the research pipeline. Setting it up takes about 5 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Install the NotebookLM CLI
npm install -g notebooklm-mcp

# 2. Authenticate with your Google account (opens browser for OAuth)
nlm login

# 3. Verify the connection works
nlm notebook_list
```

Step 3 should return a JSON list of your notebooks (empty list `[]` is fine for new accounts). If you get an authentication error, re-run `nlm login`.

Then add the MCP server to Claude Code so skills can call NotebookLM programmatically:

```bash
claude mcp add notebooklm-mcp
```

[![][back-to-top]][readme-top]

</div>

## Quick Start

**Step 1: Configure vault path and check dependencies**

```
> /revolve-setup

Detected Obsidian vault: /Users/you/Documents/Obsidian Vault
Use this path? (Enter to confirm, or type a different path)
> [Enter]

Research notes output directory (relative to vault, default: Research):
> [Enter]

Dependency check:
  yt-dlp       installed
  python3      installed
  defuddle     not installed (optional -- web mode will fall back to NotebookLM direct fetch)
  NotebookLM   connected

Config written to ~/.config/revolve/config.md
```

**Step 2: Search YouTube**

```
> /yt-search "Claude Code productivity"

| # | Title                                   | Channel          | Duration | Views   | URL                                    |

```

**Step 3: Run the full research pipeline**

```
> /research-pipeline youtube "AI productivity"

Searching YouTube for "AI productivity"...
[results table shown, you pick videos 1 and 3]

Creating NotebookLM notebook: "Research: AI Productivity - 2026-04-02"
Adding 2 video sources...
Analyzing with NotebookLM (quick mode)...

Research complete! Results saved to:
   /Users/you/Documents/Obsidian Vault/Research/2026-04-02 AI Productivity.md

Tip: Run /evolve-claude-md to update CLAUDE.md from your recent research.
```

**Step 4: Evolve CLAUDE.md from accumulated experience**

```
> /evolve-claude-md

Scanning evolution layer: 42 sessions (.jsonl) from last 7 days
Scanning reading layer: 12 notes (.md) from vault

New findings (5):
- [Error Recovery] Read large files with offset+limit to avoid token overflow
- [Tool Pattern] ssh used 499 times -- dual-machine workflow is core pattern
- [User Correction] Design tasks must not modify content text -- separate content from styling
- [Skill Usage] /research-pipeline followed by /evolve-claude-md is the standard loop
- [Work Preference] User prefers concise Chinese with mixed English technical terms

Append these to CLAUDE.md? (confirm / edit / cancel)
> confirm

CLAUDE.md evolution complete! 5 findings appended.
```

Under 10 minutes if prerequisites are installed. Under 60 minutes from scratch.

## Skills Reference

### `/revolve-setup`

Interactive configuration wizard. Detects your Obsidian vault location, checks all dependencies (yt-dlp, defuddle, python3, fswatch, NotebookLM MCP), and writes `~/.config/revolve/config.md`. Run this once before using any other skill.

```
/revolve-setup
```

No arguments. The wizard walks you through each step interactively.

---

### `/yt-search`

Search YouTube via yt-dlp and return a structured results table. Does not download videos -- only retrieves metadata (title, channel, duration, view count, upload date, URL). Results default to 10; pass a number to change.

```
/yt-search "Claude Code skills"          # 10 results (default)
/yt-search "machine learning papers" 20  # 20 results
```

Useful on its own for quick video discovery, or as a precursor to `/research-pipeline youtube`.

---

### `/research-pipeline`

The core skill. Collects source material, sends it to NotebookLM for analysis, and writes a structured Obsidian note. Supports four input modes:

```
/research-pipeline youtube "query"                 # Search YouTube, pick videos, analyze
/research-pipeline web https://example.com/article # Extract article via defuddle, analyze
/research-pipeline text "paste any content here"   # Analyze raw text directly
/research-pipeline file /path/to/document.pdf      # Analyze a local PDF or document
```

**Optional flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--deep` | Use NotebookLM deep research mode instead of quick query. Takes ~5 minutes but produces significantly more thorough analysis. |
| `--deliverable <type>` | Generate a NotebookLM deliverable after analysis. Types: `infographic`, `audio`, `slide_deck`, `report`, `quiz`. |
| `--query "<custom question>"` | Override the default analysis prompt with your own question. Default: comprehensive summary of core concepts, key findings, and practical advice. |
| `--notebook <id>` | Reuse an existing NotebookLM notebook instead of creating a new one. Useful for building up a multi-session research corpus. |

**Full example with flags:**

```
/research-pipeline youtube "transformer architecture" --deep --deliverable slide_deck
```

This searches YouTube, analyzes selected videos in deep mode (~5 min), generates a slide deck, and saves everything to Obsidian.

---

### `/evolve-claude-md`

Scans two data layers -- raw conversation logs (.jsonl files) and Obsidian notes -- to extract patterns that improve future AI sessions. Findings are appended to CLAUDE.md (never modifies existing content). Extracts six categories: tool patterns, error recovery strategies, skill usage, work preferences, user corrections, and new knowledge.

```
/evolve-claude-md              # Scan last 7 days (default)
/evolve-claude-md --days 30    # Scan last 30 days
/evolve-claude-md --days 1     # Scan today only
```

Always shows a preview and asks for confirmation before writing. Recommended frequency: weekly or after a productive research session.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]][readme-top]

</div>

## Sync Script

Standalone Python script that converts AI conversation files into Obsidian Markdown notes with automatic image extraction. Turns your scattered `.jsonl` and `.json` conversation logs into browsable, searchable notes in your vault.

| Provider | Source Path | Content |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Claude | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` | Full conversations with tool use and images |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` | Full conversations |
| OpenCode | `~/.local/state/opencode/prompt-history.jsonl` | User prompts only |
| Gemini | `~/.gemini/tmp/**/chats/session-*.json` | Full conversations |

### Usage

```bash
# One-shot sync all configured providers
python3 scripts/sync_conversations.py --verbose

# Sync only Claude conversations
python3 scripts/sync_conversations.py --provider claude --verbose

# Sync Claude and Codex only
python3 scripts/sync_conversations.py --provider claude --provider codex --verbose
```

### Automatic sync (macOS launchd)

```bash
# Install the launch agent (runs every 5 minutes and on login)
cp scripts/com.revolve.sync.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.revolve.sync.plist

# Check logs
tail -f ~/.config/revolve/sync.log
```

### Output format

Each synced conversation becomes a note in `<vault_path>/AI Conversations/<provider>/`:

```markdown
---
date: 2026-04-02
provider: claude
model: claude-opus-4
tags:
  - ai-conversation
  - claude
sync_mode: full
---

# Claude Session - 2026-04-02 14:30

## User
How do I set up NotebookLM MCP?

## Assistant
Here are the steps to set up NotebookLM MCP...
```

Sync state is tracked in `~/.config/revolve/.sync_state.json` so re-running only processes new or modified conversations. Delete the state file to force a full re-sync.

See [`scripts/README.md`][sync-docs] for launchd setup, troubleshooting, and advanced options.

[![][back-to-top]][readme-top]

</div>

## Templates

Copy from `templates/` to your vault's template folder:

- **`research-note.md`** -- Structured note with frontmatter (date, topic, source type, tags). Works with Obsidian Templater for variable substitution.
- **`research-index.md`** -- Dataview-powered index that dynamically lists and filters all research notes by date, topic, source type, or tag.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]][readme-top]

</div>

## Configuration

Run `/revolve-setup` to generate config automatically, or copy `config.md.example` to `~/.config/revolve/config.md`.

| Field | Required | Description |
